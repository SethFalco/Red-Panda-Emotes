# Elypia Emotes [![Discord][discord-members]][discord] [![GitLab Build][gitlab-build]][gitlab]
All emotes for Elypia which are open-source and available via the Apache 2.0 license.  
For information on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) please check out that file. 

Currently all emotes are being redone in HD and with an image mask for better quality and to allow multiple colors! 

## Download
You can download all emotes [here][download]!  
Sometimes GitLab Pages isn't up to date with the repo, if there's an emote you want but you can't find it in the archive feel free to check the [latest pipeline][gitlab-pipeline] and download the `Artifacts`, it should be available there!
