## OpenRaster (ORA)
All project files in this repository are .ora files, the file format
for [OpenRaster].

[OpenRaster] is an interchange format developed by the open-source
community including the developers of [GIMP] and [Krita]. It's an open
format designed to be an alternative to the proprietary PSD file.

### Why are we using ORA?
* It's a patent free and open format with a [public specification].
* It's designed to be an interchange format, unlike PSD, or XCF which
are internal structures.
* Widely backed by the open-source community, and is even the default
format for MyPaint and Nathive.
* Supports layers and other project features that formats like PNG
don't.
* Can be opened without specialized software, try opening it as a ZIP
file and look inside!

### What if my drawing program doesn't support OpenRaster?
You can use something like [GIMP] or [Krita] to convert it to a format
compatible with your drawing software first. When converting it back,
be wary of program specific features that may have been used to draw
the image when trying to convert it back to OpenRaster, you may have to
rasterize or merge some layers.

Meanwhile you could always ask them to support the format!
